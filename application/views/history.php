					<h3>MLQU Chapter, 1948 <span class="hashtag">#</span></h3>
					<p>
						In 1948, the MU KAPPA PHI was constituted by a group of noble male law students of the Manuel L. Quezon University, who drafted and passed its constitution and by-laws. These fine men took Dr. Augusto Itturalde as their fraternal adviser. Initially, it was a fraternity but later on, a sorority also emerged to accept female recruits with brighter potentials.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was of the same year (1948) when this noble fraternity was given a formal recognition by the university’s President Arsenio P. Dizon and College Dean Lorenzo P. Miravite.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fraternity’s program was to invite  law students who are morally upright and academically competent. So, some became prominent members of the BAR as well as in other fields, such as: former Presiding Justice Manuel A. Pamaran (of Sandiganbayan), former Cong. Rodolfo B. Albano, Jr., and former Solicitor Enrique M. Reyes.
